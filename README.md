# AutoDL DreamBooth Config Cheat Sheet

**This repository is deprecated.**

[CCRcmcpe/scal-sdt](https://github.com/CCRcmcpe/scal-sdt) and
[Mikubill/naifu-diffusion](https://github.com/Mikubill/naifu-diffusion)
are easy to use enough that I don't think another wrapper will be
beneficial. Just use them directly.

Checkout [this gist](https://gist.github.com/crosstyan/bc1de3f74ceac1e43b491af58a05c69b)
for Docker configuration.

[SCAL-SDT Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dCwUGjgi3IralIB9jIfFPkEVUVcXw-G_)
is also recommended to read.

If you insist you can still read [original README](old_REAME.md).
